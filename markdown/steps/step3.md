title: "Pay down high interest debts"
---

After you ensure you're taking advantage of your employer match, you should use your extra money to pay down your high interest debt (e.g., debts much over 4% interest rate).

In all cases, you should make the minimum payments on all of your debts before paying down specific debts more quickly.

There are two main methods of paying down debt:

* In the **avalanche** method, debts are paid down in order of interest rate, starting with the debt that carries the highest interest rate.  This is the financially optimal method of paying down debt, and you will pay less money overall compared to the snowball method.

* The **snowball** method, popularized by Dave Ramsey, debts are paid down in order of balance size, starting with the smallest.  Paying off small debts first may give you a psychological boost and improve one's cash flow situation, as paid off debts free up minimum payments.  The downside is that larger loans (that may be at higher interest rates) are left untouched for longer, costing more in the long run.

As an example, Debtor Dan has the following situation:

* Loan A: $1,100 with a minimum payment of $100/month, 5% interest
* Loan B: $3,300 with a minimum payment of $300/month, 10% interest
* Sudden windfall: $2,000

Dan needs to first pay $100 + $300 = $400 to make the minimum payments on loans A and B so the payments are recorded as "on time."  The extra $1,600 can either go towards Loan A (smallest balance, snowball method), eliminating it with $600 left to go towards Loan B, or Loan B entirely (highest interest rate, avalanche method).

What's the best method?  /r/personalfinance tends to favor the avalanche method, but do not underestimate the psychological side of debt payments.  If you think that the psychological boost from paying off a smaller debt sooner will help you stay the course, do it!  You can always switch things up later.  The important thing is to start paying your debts as soon as you can, and to keep paying them until they're gone.

**Should I be in a hurry to pay off lower interest loans?  What rate is "low" enough to where I should just pay the minimum?**

Depending on your attitude towards debt, you may want to stop paying more than the minimum payment on loans with low interest rates once you have paid all other loans above that threshold.  A common argument is that the long-term return from investments in the stock market will likely exceed the interest rate from a low-interest loan.  While this has been true in the past, keep in mind that paying down a loan is a guaranteed return at the loan's interest rate.  Stock performance is anything but guaranteed.  The rough consensus is that loans above 4% interest should be paid off early in the debt reduction phase, while anything under that can be stretched out.

**Shouldn't I stretch out a loan to improve my credit score?**

No.  Loans should never be stretched out longer than they need to be, as you should not pay a cent in interest more than you have to for the sake of improving one's credit score.  Interest rate should be the sole factor in whether or not you pay extra on a loan or not.
