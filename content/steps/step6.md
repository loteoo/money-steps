Once you're on track for retirement, there is more flexibility for discretionary income.  The basic options are:

* Use tax-advantaged savings for anticipated future medical and education costs.
  - If you have an eligible high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and qualify, a [health savings account (HSA)](https://clark.com/health-health-care/clarks-health-savings-account-guide/) is a great way to save for future medical costs.
  - If you wish to save for college for your kids, yourself, or other relatives, consider a [529 fund in your state](http://www.clark.com/clarks-529-plan-guide).

* Save for more immediate goals.  Common examples include saving for down payments for homes, saving for vehicles, paying down low interest loans ahead of schedule, and vacation funds.

* Save more so you can potentially retire early (also see "advanced methods", below), only using taxable accounts after maxing out tax-advantaged options.

* Make an impact through giving. One of the rewards of practicing a sound financial lifestyle is that giving becomes easier.  If you're on top of your health care costs, future education costs, and you've made it to this step, you can help [make a difference for others by giving](https://www.charitynavigator.org/).  If you can't afford to make monetary donations, [there are other ways to give](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3Acharity+author%3AAutoModerator&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all#res-hide-options).

How you order those options is up to you, but the flowchart recommends prioritizing an HSA if you have a qualified HDHP and then a 529 if applicable to your situation.

The time frame for these goals will dictate what kind of account you save in.  For short-term goals (under 3-5 years), you'll want to use an FDIC-insured savings account, CDs, or I Bonds.  If your time horizon is longer or you can afford to adjust your plans, you might consider something riskier like a balanced index fund or a three-fund portfolio (both are a mix of stocks and bonds).  The best savings or investment vehicle will vary depending on time frame and risk tolerance.  Feel free to start a thread with the details of your situation and we will help you.

Keep in mind that (especially for a young person) the more time your money has to grow, the more powerful the effects of compounding will be on your savings.  If the goal is early retirement (even before the age of 59½), you should definitely maximize the use of any available tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 401(k) plans, HSA accounts, etc.) before using a taxable account because there are [ways to get money out of tax-advantaged accounts before 59½ without penalty](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/434ey1/psa_retirement_funds_are_not_locked_up_until_age/).

If you are using a taxable account for any goal, you'll want to have a decent grasp on [asset allocation in multiple accounts](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation_in_multiple_accounts) and [tax-efficient fund placement](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement).
