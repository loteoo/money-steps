Once your emergency fund is set, the next step is to ensure you are contributing enough to your employer-sponsored retirement plan (if available) to get any matching funds from your employer (if they offer them).  The reason you do this before paying off high interest debt is that employer matching funds are risk-free, guaranteed returns on your investments at (usually) a higher rate than your debts.  This step applies to any employer-sponsored account where the employer contributes money or matches contributions (in addition to some [401(k) plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k), this step applies to all SIMPLE IRAs, some 403(b) plans, some 457 plans, and some [Thrift Savings Plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/tsp)).

For example, if your employer offers 50% matching on the first 6% of your contributions to a 401(k), you want to make sure you contribute 6% of your salary to take full advantage of the match.  Instant 50% return on investment is pretty good!  Be aware that 401(k) contributions must come from payroll deductions, so if you have a sum of money and want to take advantage of the match you need to increase your contribution percentage from your paycheck and use your lump sum for expenses.

**What if my employer doesn't match, or I don't have an employer-sponsored plan?**

Skip step 2, move to step 3.

**What if my employer contributes to an account on my behalf regardless of whether I contribute or not?**

You are very fortunate.  Open the account, make sure you are getting the match, and move to step 3.

**What if I am self-employed?**

If you are self-employed, you can also make your own employer contributions to your [401(k)](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/one-participant-401k-plans) or [SIMPLE IRA](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/simple-ira-tips-for-the-sole-proprietor), but you should do this as part of step 5.
