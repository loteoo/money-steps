After you've funded an IRA, if you still have money you want to put away for retirement then you should go back and round out your contributions to your employer-sponsored account (if available) so you are contributing as much as your budget allows.  For specifics on 401(k) plans, see [the wiki on 401(k) plans](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k).  As in step 2, you can't make direct contributions to your 401(k) (they have to come from payroll deductions).  Adjust your contributions from your paycheck accordingly.

If you are self-employed, look into opening an Individual 401(k), a SEP-IRA, or a SIMPLE IRA for this step.

If you are not self-employed and your employer does not sponsor a retirement account, you will need to use a taxable account for this step.  Ask your employer to consider providing a 401(k) or at least a SIMPLE IRA.

Before saving for other goals, you should save at least 15% and up to 20% of your gross income for retirement.  If you are [behind on retirement savings](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/how-much-money-do-i-need-to-retire), you should try to save more than 15% if you can.  If you can't save 15%, start with 10% or any other amount until you are able to save more.

**My 401(k) plan is awful.  Should I still contribute to it?**

Yes.  You should always take advantage of your tax-advantaged retirement accounts before saving for retirement in a taxable account.  The effect of high expenses really only starts to bite after long periods of time and 401(k) plans are quite portable.  After leaving a job, you can do a [rollover of your employer plan](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf) into an IRA and sometimes you can roll it into a new 401(k) with a new employer. Bad 401(k) plans can be turned into great IRAs eventually.
