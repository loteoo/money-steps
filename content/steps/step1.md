An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up.  [Unexpected travel](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1xru6s/this_is_why_you_have_an_emergency_fund/), [essential appliance replacement](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15wa61/the_beauty_of_the_emergency_fund_it_makes_things/), and [sudden medical procedures](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ic7ft/friendly_reminder_emergency_fund/) are all user-submitted examples of emergency funds in action.  If you need to draw from your emergency fund at any time, your first priority as soon as you get back on your feet should be to replenish it.  Treat your emergency fund right and it will return the favor.

**How should I size my emergency fund?**

For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good.  A larger emergency fund (e.g., 9 to 12 months) may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain.

**What if I have credit card debt?**

Credit cards generally have very high interest rates (typically 15-25% APR) and that is a pretty big deal. If this applies to you, you should prioritize paying down the debt first.

A smaller emergency fund of $1,000 (or 1 month of expenses) is temporarily acceptable while paying off credit card debt or other debts with interest rates above 10%.

**What kind of account should I hold my emergency fund in?**

Generally emergency funds should be held in safe investments you can liquidate in a hurry.  FDIC-insured savings or checking accounts are the most common choice.  CDs and [I-bonds](http://www.moneycrashers.com/series-i-savings-bonds/) can be used too.  Things that should *not* be used include stocks, credit cards, HELOCs, or anything that is volatile in value or that can be taken away without warning (such as lines of credit).
