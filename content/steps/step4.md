The next step is to contribute to an IRA for the current tax year.  You can also contribute for the previous tax year if it's between January 1st and April 15th.  See [the IRA wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) for more information on IRAs.  Try to save up to 15% of your gross income until reaching the annual limit of $6,000.

**Why contribute to an IRA if I have a 401(k)?**

IRAs generally have better fund choices than employer-sponsored plans because you can open one with the provider of your choice.  Low cost providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab all offer low expense ratio index funds.  However, you may swap step 5 with step 4 if either of the following statements is true:

- Your employer offers an excellent 401(k), 403(b), 457, SEP-IRA, or SIMPLE IRA that has low expense index funds (i.e., a domestic stock index fund under 0.1% expense ratio, an international stock index fund under 0.2% expense ratio, and a bond index fund under 0.1% expense ratio).
- You have access to the U.S. Federal government's Thrift Savings Plan.

One common situation where it may be advantageous to swap step 5 with step 4 is if you exceed the IRA income limit for making a fully deductible Traditional IRA contribution.

**Higher education expenses**

If you will be going to college in the next few years (or if you are already in college) and you will will be responsible for some college expenses (i.e., parents, scholarships, grants, etc. are not covering everything) then saving for college should take precedence over saving for retirement.  College savings should be placed in low risk, low volatility investments like your emergency fund.

Consider whether the cost of any degree that you may pursue will help propel you into a career that is both financially and non-financially rewarding to you.  Also see [advice for high school students and teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/teachme) if you're 15 to 20 years old.

Note that saving for the future education expenses of children is step 6, below.  Both you and your children can borrow for college, but you cannot borrow for retirement.
